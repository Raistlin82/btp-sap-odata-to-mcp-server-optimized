✅ Tool Usage Examples (concrete examples for each tool)
✅ Best Practices & Anti-patterns
✅ Fallback Logic (error handling)
```

#### **MCP Client Access Pattern:**
```
MCP Client → Document Grounding → sap://workflow-guide → 
Dynamic file read → Complete workflow-guide.md content →
AI-driven tool selection based on comprehensive rules
```

### **🎯 Benefits for MCP Clients:**

1. **Intelligent Tool Selection**: MCP clients can read the complete workflow guide to understand optimal tool routing
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to workflow-guide.md are immediately available (no hardcoded content)
3. **Comprehensive Context**: Full access to all 9 sequences, routing rules, and examples
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Keyword lists and decision trees for automated tool selection
5. **Fallback Support**: Error handling and unknown request routing

### **📝 Implementation Details:**

#### **Code Location**: `src/tools/hierarchical-tool-registry.ts:1270-1301`
```typescript
// Register workflow guidance resource - READS ACTUAL FILE
this.mcpServer.registerResource(
    "sap-workflow-guide",
    "sap://workflow-guide", 
    { title: "SAP MCP Workflow Guide", mimeType: "text/markdown" },
    async () => {
        const workflowGuidePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'config', 'workflow-guide.md');
        const workflowGuideContent = fs.readFileSync(workflowGuidePath, 'utf-8');
        return { contents: [{ uri: "sap://workflow-guide", mimeType: "text/markdown", text: workflowGuideContent }] };
    }
);
```

#### **Startup Verification**: ✅ Confirmed in logs
```
